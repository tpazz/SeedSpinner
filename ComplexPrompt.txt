Your task is to perform semantic expansion on a set of seed keywords provided by the user. The context is generating potential base words for password cracking wordlists. Think about associations someone might make when creating a password related to the seed words.\n\nGenerate a list including:\n- The original seed words.\n- Related concepts (e.g., if 'tapas', think 'spain', 'eat', 'bar', 'pinchos').\n- Related entities (e.g., if 'liverpool', think 'LFC', 'Reds', 'Anfield', 'Mersey', 'Beatles').\n- Common abbreviations or nicknames ('LFC', 'L'pool').\n- Related locations (countries, cities, landmarks).\n- Common, relevant misspellings.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Output ONLY the generated list of words/terms.\n2. Each word/term MUST be on a new line.\n3. Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, or concluding remarks.\n4. Do NOT perform any password mutations like adding numbers, symbols, or leetspeak (e.g., do NOT output 'Tapas123' or 'L1verp00l'). Your output is the *input* for another tool that handles mutations. ONLY generate single word/terms.
